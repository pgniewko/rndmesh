DESCRIPTION
==================================================
The ```rndmesh``` library, using Simulated Annealing Monte Carlo, generates points on a sphere and
triangulates the surface with the vertices defined by those points.


GETTING THE CODE
==================================================
* To get the code:
```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:pawelgniewek/rndmesh.git
```

* To obtain the most recent version of the code:
```
git pull origin master
```

COMPILING AND INSTALLATION - UNIX
==================================================

* build a library by typing:
```
make
```
